Developed a web scraper which obtained data from the official Premier League website. More specifically I
was interested in the minutes at which all goals were scored for each season, in order to predict for future
seasons, when in a football match we are most likely to expect a goal. Graphs were generated through
PowerBi and Excel. This project's purpose is to showcase my knowledge of Python, SQL and Data Analysis.
